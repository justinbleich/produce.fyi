# produce.fyi on 11ty/netlify cms (last updated 1.30)

## Local development

### 1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate.git my-blog-name
```


### 2. Navigate to the directory

```
cd my-blog-name
```

Specifically have a look at `.eleventy.js` to see if you want to configure any Eleventy options differently.

### 3. Install dependencies locally

```
npm install @11ty/eleventy
```

### 4. Edit _data/metadata.json

This file contains your site title and author details, and can be used to store any other commonly used site data.

### 5. Run Eleventy (builds the site)

```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Or build automatically when a template changes:
```
npx @11ty/eleventy --watch
```

Or in debug mode:
```
DEBUG=* npx @11ty/eleventy
```
