### What is **Produce**?

Produce is a token-gated social community on a [private Discord server](https://discord.gg/UHuSKZ66MC). It's a community built around music production and the music industry.

### How do I join?

To join you'll need to hold between 30 tokens (GA) and 70 tokens (On the List). *These can be purchased on Uniswap (coming soon).*

### What's the point?

We've created a vibrant community that provides a place for both beginners and entrenched vets to access industry knowledge, production tips, and opportunities (with some additional insight on navigating web3 as a musician). The financial incentive is real, too. $PROD will increase in value as the community continues to expand. Likely, the token will additionally become a governance tool to run initiatives, with a host of community-based ideas being discussed. Those holding $PROD are able to vote these initiatives through.

### Okay, I'm ready.

Rad! [Join us](https://discord.gg/UHuSKZ66MC).
